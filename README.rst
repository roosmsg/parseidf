# parseidf.py

Parses an IDF file (as used by EnergyPlus) into a dictionary of lists in the following manner:

- each IDF object is represented by a list of its fields, with the first field being the object type.

- each such list is appended to a list of objects with the same type in the dictionary, indexed by type:

   { A => [[A, x, y, z], [A, a, b, c]],
     B => [[B, 1, 2], [B, 1, 2, 3]] }

- the index keys are all capitalized.

- also, all field values are strings, i.e. no interpretation of the values is made.

# Example

```python
import parseidf

with open(r'in.idf', 'r') as f:
    idf = parseidf.parse(f.read())
print idf.keys()  # lists the object types in the idf file
print idf['OUTPUT:VARIABLE']  # lists all the Output:Variable objects in the idf file
```

# Dependencies

parseidf depends on PLY (Python Lex & Yacc): https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ply/3.4
